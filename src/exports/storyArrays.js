"There once was a goat named *. They were in a small goat village called _ that could be found far far away,  _ fields of _, over the _ mountains, and through a _ forest of _.  One day, they woke up to snow in the air, their breath weaving clouds in the air, and knew that winter had finally arrived. They woke up their _ siblings, and got ready for the day with warm bowls of porridge and cider. Tossing on a scarf and hat _ bounded out into the snowy wonderderland created the night before. First off they went to check on the old neighbor _ to make sure they had fire wood and needed food to make it through the coming cold days. And then away to gather fruit and ingredients for a winter pie! First they set off to get flour from a _ and _ chicken down the road. And butter from the _ old cows up the lane. Sugar from the _ goose over the river. First * headed for the chicken. They wanted to trade something shiny for the flour. So the brave little goat ventured into the woods looking for a shiny stone. While they searched and searched they couldn’t find any. Exasperated and worried about time the goat sat down to think, and upon looking up saw all the glittering icicles in the trees, and they had a plan. They continued foraging to see if they could find any fruits for the pie, and found some _, that could me cooked up into a nice filling. And on their way back they took a running start and bashed their head into the trunk of one of the trees causing icicles to come dancing down. This felt shiny enough and with their fruit bag in tow they headed back to the chicken to strike a deal. Second * headed to the cows. The cows only wanted a song in return, and the goat sang a jaunt rendition of twinkle twinkle little _, and batty old cows were quite pleased.

What am I?( * thought and though. (A pencil!(The goose was actually looking for a ‘candle’, but still accepted the answer and passed over the sugar. With their bag of supplies and still some daylight left the goat headed home to start their pie. With the filling made and the crust rolled out the goat’s mom walked in and let to goat know (You’re still missing and ingredient((Love!( and placed a kiss on the little goat’s head and helped them put the pie together and into the over. Warm smells filled the house as all the goat family at their supper. Once the table was cleared * proudly pulled out their pie, and cut a slice for every family member. They all ate, enjoyed the delicious pie, and with full bellies soon had heavy eyelids. It was a cool winter night with warm oven air in the house, where they all had sweet pastry dreams of the winter adventures they could have tomorrow."
